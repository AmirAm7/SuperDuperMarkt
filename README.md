        

          I used the following technologies and frameworks for the project:
        - Spring Boot : I wanted to use Spring Boot, so our config is simplified.
        - Hibernate/JPA : because it is a very popular ORM and I used it to implement Table and its inheritance
        - REST API : because it is a very popular API and it was suitable for this project.
        - JUnit/Mockito : for test my logic service.
        - Maven : because maven is a very popular build tool and dependency manager
		- Lombok : lombok is a very popular library and by using it, I can reduce the amount of boilerplate code.
		- Observer Pattern : because it is a very popular design pattern and it was suitable for this project.
		   - > Faced with the question that we should issue the expired products every day. I want to get notified whenever there is any change.
		       I can use this pattern to notify important and specific people of possible changes. I used also Spring-Scheduling.
		- Decorator Pattern : because it is a very popular design pattern and it was suitable for this project.
		   - >  The decorator pattern ensures you are providing Cheese with an instance of Product, 
		         ensuring compatibility while modifying the original behavior of Product
